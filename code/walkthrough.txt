Monstropolis - Game Info

GAME GOAL --> Find Boo and take her to the Door.
There are two ways to get to the door once you get to the "Hall Entrance":
  -shorter route: straight through the Main Hall, but you need to "use sock" to pass through. The game will not allow you to go east from the
                  main hall to the door if you have not used the sock to cause distraction.
  -longer route: through the receptionist and vent. Extra 4 rounds/turns will be counted for every turn you spend in the reception.


Features and quirks:
- You can "use sock" in any location to create chaos/distraction, however you can only use this feature once. If the sock is used anywhere
other than inside the Main Hall, the longer route to the door has to be taken.
- NOTE that "use sock" != "drop sock". You only create chaos by using the sock, while dropping simply removes it from your inventory and adds
it to the current location.
- Every turn is counted, meaning that wrong inputs also count as a turn. With the expection of the "help" command.
- Every round spent at the "Reception" means +4 turns on the game's turn counter.
- The "hide" command will describe a randomized hiding location everytime you call it.
- All other commands are listed/described by inputing the "help" command.


Important Locations:
- Corridor (spawn location)
- Bathroom (initially contains Boo)
- Locker Room (initially contains the sock)
- Main Hall (requires "chaos = true" to go east)
- Reception (lose 4 rounds instead of 1)
- Door (final destination)
